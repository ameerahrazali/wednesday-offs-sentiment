n3c1jk6,t3_1m0t58w,Sure_Comfort_7031,1,"I'm with you ish. 

I don't like the 4x10. It takes two more hours every day. I'd rather those two hours every day and a fifth day with two hours, rather than lose 4 days of 2 hours every day. 

As it is i can come home, go for a bike ride, take the dog for a hike, and then make dinner, and it's only 7. If I'm working until 6 instead of 4, there goes that time. Especially during the winters and leads in and out when the days get darker earlier. When it's dark at 5:30, and i get out at 4, i can do stuff. 

Then Friday comes along and your whole morning is just recovering all the shit from the week that you put off. 

So for me 5x8 >>>>> 4x10.

You're never more than 2 days away from a day off. It makes everything much more manageable. knowing that in 2 days you'll get a day to play catch up is such a weight off your shoulders. 

I think 3 day weekends make days like Labor day,LL day and thanksgiving less special. Who cares about Labor Day if you already have a 3 day weekend every weekend.

n3cy7k6,t3_1m0t58w,captainburger31,1,"I hear you and maybe for some that’d work but I see a few issues:

-The one you already pointed out that it limits the chances of a mini-vacation. You can do PTO for sure, but it’d be so nice to be able to fly out Friday night, have Saturday off to chill, watch the Sunday game with family, then fly back in Monday in time for an afternoon workout without burning PTO.

-The start-stop would mess with my week. Typically early Monday feels lethargic I like to warm the engines with early admin tasks and get into work-mode, then go and wind down Friday afternoon. It’d make Monday and Thursday mornings feel like 2 Monday mornings and Tuesday + Friday afternoons thinking about the weekend.

Imo, it’d be nice if days off were done in rotations where say X group gets Monday off and Y Fridays off. Otherwise, if say everyone gets Friday off, you run into one of the main issues where on the off days many places like the dentist, doctor, bank, DMV, etc are also closed.

I have one whole day in the middle of the week where i don't have to worry about shit being closed on weekends and there's normally plenty of avialbillity in mornings for things like barbers, doc offices, dentists ect... 
More normal errands like grocery store, gym, laudry are way less packed. And with a whole day in the middle of the week by the time i get to the weekends i can actually fukin enjoy them without stressing about the laundry list of adult BS i gotta get done when I'm not working. 


I personally like the work two days then take a break thing ive got going. but id personally say any of the three days that aren't monday or friday is great too have off for the same reasons.

n3deglp,t3_1m0t58w,RealCanadianDragon,1,"I've always felt this way too.

With Monday or Friday off, it gets to the point where during the weekend you've basically done everything you've needed or wanted to do and the weekend just blends together.

With Wednesday off, you approach the week this way:

Monday (you didn't have work the day prior, and everyone's coming in to the day with the ""Monday feeling"")

Tuesday (while you had work yesterday, you don't have work tomorrow so that gives this a ""Friday feeling"")

Wednesday (obviously the day off is great to have and would feel almost like a Sunday)

Thursday (might partially feel like a Monday since you didn't have work the day prior, but you still have the usual Thursday feeling as the weeks almost over)

Friday (the same ""Friday feeling"" as usual)


And on top of that, there's 0 days under this schedule where you have 3 days of work in a row (meaning you worked yesterday, worked today and worked tomorrow) which happens 3 times under a normal 5 day work week, so a single day less of work gives you 3 fewer ""grind days"".",1752630203.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1m0t58w/an_ideal_4day_work_week_would_have_wednesday_off/n3deglp/

Now I work a full time job (5 days/wk) where I must work one weekend day, but I pick my other days.

n3ds3hb,t3_1m0t58w,NitroKit,1,"With Friday off, you still get a 5 day mini vacation by taking 2 days PTO. You can even choose to tack it on to the beginning or end or one day from both. Wednesday off locks you in to 2 choices. 

You can also choose a 4 day mini vacation if you like. You can literally do a weekend getaway and have another day and a half to settle back in. Yet another option, do a half day of PTO for the actual travel and save a half day of PTO. 

For me specifically, I generally have work projects that take more than 2 days of focused critical thinking. If I have to take a break every 2 days, I'm losing momentum and probably thinking about work during my time off if it's a stressful time. Wednesday would be actively detrimental since my progress is halted and I can't focus on relaxing.

I also really enjoy working Fridays because it's a much more relaxed atmosphere and much easier then to socialise after work, whether it's with work friends or others. I'm much less likely to want to go out on a Friday if I've spent the day at home, than if I'm already out.

Wednesday means I work 2 days, then get a little break. I can relax, cook, clean, do whatever I want. If I have a sick day, it's always 2 or 3 days off (Mon/Fri back onto the weekend and Tues/Thur onto my wednesday). Most public holidays are Mondays, so for 1 AL day, I get a 5 day weekend. I can do mid week meal prep.. the benefits are massive.

He said we could go away easier if it was Fridays but realistically we only go away a few times a year and if I have a 3 day weekend every weekend, I know I'd just end up wasting it because mentally I'd still have 2 more days to relax.

n3eq1kf,t3_1m0t58w,MrCockingFinally,1,"Assuming you are talking about reducing a 40 hour work week (8x5) to a 32 hour week (8x4) IMO the better solution is to reduce working hours. So 5 days a week, but only 6 hours per day (5x6) 30 hours.

Advantages are as follows:

1. Fewer hours per week. 30 vs 32

2. No productivity drop for office jobs vs 40 hour week. Studies show most people actually only work for like 4 hours a day. Take one day away, that's one less day of work. Take 2 hours away, you probably don't even touch productivity.

3. Provides off cycle benefits. E.g. stores and government services could be open 8am to 8pm with 2 shifts of 6 hours each. So no matter what your hours are, you can easily get stuff done during the week. 

4. Even having an extra day off on the weekend won't solve the fundamental issue that the week is exhausting. Like congratulations, now you just have a dedicated chores day. But if you work 2 hours less per day, suddenly you can get all your chores, gym, errands etc done during the week and still have time to unwind for a bit after work. So weekends are only 2 days, but they are true rest days. 

5. Most schools only run for +- 6 hours, meaning parents need to arrange for child minding every day after school. But if work is also 6 hours, your schedule aligns with your child. Much less child minding costs, more time to spend with your kids.",1752651678.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1m0t58w/an_ideal_4day_work_week_would_have_wednesday_off/n3eq1kf/

n3f1avs,t3_1m0t58w,npc4lyfe,1,"Your reasoning isn't bad, but I can't personally agree. I do project work, so not only would it be difficult because my clients would likely not have Wedenesdays off, it's also too disruptive to the flow of progression for a project. I think what would realistically happen, at least in my professional experience, would be that employees would start to ""kinda"" work on Wednesdays in small ways, and then that would progress until it became basically implied that ""good"" employees just work on their Wednesday off. 

As it stands now, people in my field already basically don't work on Fridays (which ironically is when I get most of my work done in my particular position because people aren't constantly badgering me with calls and meetings), so I think it's the best contender for the axe if 4 day work weeks became a normal thing. 

As a side note, remember that private companies in the USA are under no legal obligation to offer any days off, including weekends. They only do because it's considered normal, and they'd have a hard time hiring anyone if they didn't.

My company offers a 4-day workweek.  This would basically mean that I would have to work 8am-6pm.

I would love the three day weekend, but working until 6 would screw up my day.   I work until 4:30.  Between 4:30pm and 6pm, I have free time to do whatever I wanna do.  I go outside, cycle, I do whatever.  I get shit done.  I like having that block of time FREE.   If I switched to the 10/4 schedule, there is a significant portion of the year where I wouldn’t see daylight on my workdays.  I also have limited time to work out, or do whatever I want to do. 

Now if you told me that I could work a 4 day workweek, for 32 hours, and I can still end the day at 4:30 - fuck yeah, I’d do it.

But, this might not be my job forever.  If I become accustomed to a 4 day workweek, I really don’t want to find myself struggling to adjust back to a 5 day workweek.

n3gr9gm,t3_1m0t58w,mavenwaven,1,"Truly agree- no matter HOW bad a work day is, knowing you only have one more shift maximum before having a day off helps your mentality so much- instead of looking at 4 days in a row as a seemingly endless slog. 

People saying ""a day for rest, a day for socialization, a day for errands""... you realize you can still have that, if you just assign any one of those to Wednesday?? Even if everyone else is still on a normal schedule, make it your errand day, or your rest day, and free up your normal weekend!

To me things also just don't ""build up"" the way they do when I work a 5 day schedule. Having a mid-week reset means my house doesn't get as trashed to begin with, I don't need to dedicate a whole Saturday to cleaning and admin tasks. It spreads out much more naturally instead of becoming a mountain of tasks you collect throughout the week and  save to do on your day off.

n3ikxf1,t3_1m0t58w,BoomSplashCollector,1,"When my kid was a baby/toddler, I'd occasionally take Wednesday off of work (with her in daycare) as a bit of a life catch-up. Sometimes even just half a day. My life was so hectic on a day to day basis, and especially on weekdays, that having that occasional catch-up day in the middle of the week was extremely valuable. At this point in my life, I'm not sure -- I think a mid-day day off could be nice if it were company-wide, but if it's just me adjusting my schedule or taking the occasional single day off it's easier for me to feel like it's worth it if it's on a Friday and I have three days in a row to focus on non-work stuff. Actually, I think my order of preference would be 1. Friday, 2. Wednesday, 3. Monday. That way I can spend Friday getting all of the chores and boring adulting stuff done and have all weekend to just relax or do fun stuff I want to do. If I did Sat, Sun, Mon, I'd be very aware that other folks were working on Monday, and filling up my inbox with all sorts of shit I'd have to catch up on Tuesday. Folks don't work as hard on Fridays, so there will be fewer extra emails than if I took Monday off. Also, since I know I am likely to front-load the un-fun stuff in my weekends, I'd rather do that on the day I'm still feeling the residual work stress.

n3kn4mm,t3_1m0t58w,Sythonate,1,"Ideal? Naw. As someone currently working 4 9s and has tried every combination over the last few years, imo Friday > Monday > Wednesday > Thursday > Tuesday. 

Friday wins because many jobs, including mine, are front loaded with plenty going on at the start of the week which can be a pain to come back to if you have Monday or Tuesday off. 

Also a lot more events and social gatherings/parties etc happen Friday nights than any other work night, which you can be well rested and ready for by having the day off. Also having 3 days in a row off, as many have mentioned, feels like a proper break from work in a way that 2 in a row don't. 

Also, if you're in the middle of a project it can be quite annoying to work on it one day, have a day off, and try to come back to it.

Having said that though, any 4 day combination is way better than 5 days imo. I can't go back.",1752725728.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1m0t58w/an_ideal_4day_work_week_would_have_wednesday_off/n3kn4mm/

n3kumxu,t3_1m0t58w,FredRex18,1,"I’ve worked Monday-Friday, 7 on/7 off, and the weird broken up weeks. 

7 on/7 off was ideal for me. Sure, pushing through 7 12-hour days in a row was tough. But then a week off every other week was worth it. Having days off together makes it possible to actually have some time for rest and have some time for home tasks/hobbies/etc. 

Monday-Friday is the next best. 

The random day off dropped in the middle of the week was by far the worst setup. A lot of people have “Sunday scaries.” Congrats, now you get them twice a week. Additionally, many people use that first day off (or at least the first evening/next morning) as a rest day. The extra day in the middle of the week was almost always worthless for me. I’d want to go to bed around the same time as normal because I’d worked the day before and I’d have to go back to work the day after. I couldn’t stay up late the day I had off because I had to work the next day.

I had one week off a couple weeks ago and I'll have another week off a few weeks after they all come back.

If I take two or even three weeks off in a row, I find it almost impossible, to the point of experiencing serious mental distress, to get back to a normal routine again afterwards. One week I can handle. But three weeks as is the norm here in Denmark? That's torture. I cease being able to function as an adult if I'm given that much free time in a row.

n3glopu,t1_n3bwbdo,Ok_Possession_6457,1,"I just mentioned this in another comment, but stuff like this is one of the reasons why I'm hesitant to take the 4 day workweek option for my job.

A 3 day weekend seems nice, but I might not be here forever.  That kind of schedule is not guaranteed to be a permanent thing.  I would *hate* to readjust to a 5 day workweek after becoming accustomed to a 4 day workweek.

Even adjusting from remote to in-office work was really difficult.   Last year, I took a in-office role, which only lasted 3 months (did not work out).   Driving to work and being around coworkers again wasn't the hard part.  The hard part was having my TIME taken away.  Even though my remote job has me taking business calls all day, I *still* have the ability to throw the laundry in, fold it, vacuum, sweep, tend to the garden real quick, wipe down the counters.  I can multi-task around the house while maintaining a high productivity level at work.

And if your remote day is slow?  Great.  You can do something that you otherwise wouldn't have been able to do if you had to leave the house.  Network cut out and IT is working on it?  Great!  Let me take a walk.  Let me sneak in a quick workout that I would have otherwise done later, but now I have that time back.

You have no idea how relieved I was when that in-office role didn't work out, and I got my old job back.  I was kept on payroll and everything.  Being able to work from home - even on a busy day - gives you so much time, it's hard to go back.  It's hard to go back to working in an office and not being able to throw the laundry in, or be able to do something that's in arm's reach, and having to do that shit during your ""free"" time.  So knowing this, I would have a hard time giving up a 3 day weekend after becoming used to it.",1752679176.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1m0t58w/an_ideal_4day_work_week_would_have_wednesday_off/n3glopu/

n3dryaw,t1_n3byyoj,Probate_Judge,47,"'Wednesday's off' is a pretty great schedule for people and for productivity.

I know people like their 3-day extended breaks for obvious reasons, but they're not as refreshing imo.

'Wednesday's off' reinvigorates for the other two days. With a day off in the middle of the week, that's like taking a long lunch break in the middle of the day.  It's a relief valve.

Without, at 4x10 hour days in a row...one can get strung out, depending on the job.

That 4 days of stress/exhaustion adds up to higher than in the 'Wednesday's off' situation, leaving the weekend for recuperation rather than recreation.

That's part of why we do 5x8 generally.  That cuts down on the exhaustion per-day and leaves time in between to relax and recover, leaving you fresh enough for weekends.

___

Speaking of non-traditional...

There was a period where I did 2 days on, 2 days off.   (Military, helping out base security post 9/11, never actually deployed, this is all *on* US bases)
 
Aside from working 7x12 or even 16, which we did a few times, even as maintenance(overburdened as equip breaks down all at once, not understaffed at regular job), that 2on2off was the worst.

The 2 days on were ""12 hour days"", but more like 15 with showing up ungodly early to get issued firearms, and being at post to the very minute of end of shift then having to go back to the armory to turn in fire-arms.  Factor in walking time if they didn't give you a ride(a ride was never guaranteed, staffing *and* equip was short at my base) you couldn't convey issued firearms in private vehicles) to your duty station(eg base gates)...and it could easily be over 16.

Going at it that hard wears you out, your days off are almost entirely recuperation....and it's a bad idea to stay up late-night partying because the human body has a hard time flipping sleep schedules around every few days.  Unless you worked nights of course, then you had to stay up *all* night on your days off.

And we were just augmenting for a month at a stretch(then a new set of augmentees would help out).

The real military police did *4days on 4days off* at that ~15-16 hours a day pace at that time.

5x8 is a cake-walk in comparison, and 'Wednesdays' off would be heavenly.",1752635093.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1m0t58w/an_ideal_4day_work_week_would_have_wednesday_off/n3dryaw/

You can't compare Wednesday's off to holidays and PTO. The only way to really find out how people feel about Wednesdays off is for people to actually try it for a while.

Having two days of work and then a break then two more and a break is the right energy for me (of course, not for everybody). That day of nobody around is energy replenishing to me.

n3eujbz,t1_n3cb1hs,serious_sarcasm,1,"> Some workmen, indeed, when they can earn in four days what will maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This, however, is by no means the case with the greater part. Workmen, on the contrary, when they are liberally paid by the piece, are very apt to overwork themselves, and to ruin their health and constitution in a few years. A carpenter in London, and in some other places, is not supposed to last in his utmost vigour above eight years. Something of the same kind happens in many other trades, in which the workmen are paid by the piece; as they generally are in manufactures, and even in country labour, wherever wages are higher than ordinary. Almost every class of artificers is subject to some peculiar infirmity occasioned by excessive application to their peculiar species of work. Ramuzzini, an eminent Italian physician, has written a particular book concerning such diseases. We do not reckon our soldiers the most industrious set of people among us; yet when soldiers have been employed in some particular sorts of work, and liberally paid by the piece, their officers have frequently been obliged to stipulate with the undertaker, that they should not be allowed to earn above a certain sum every day, according to the rate at which they were paid. Till this stipulation was made, mutual emulation, and the desire of greater gain, frequently prompted them to overwork themselves, and to hurt their health by excessive labour. Excessive application, during four days of the week, is frequently the real cause of the idleness of the other three, so much and so loudly complained of. Great labour, either of mind or body, continued for several days together is, in most men, naturally followed by a great desire of relaxation, which, if not restrained by force, or by some strong necessity, is almost irresistible. It is the call of nature, which requires to be relieved by some indulgence, sometimes of ease only, but sometimes too of dissipation and diversion. If it is not complied with, the consequences are often dangerous and sometimes fatal, and such as almost always, sooner or later, bring on the peculiar infirmity of the trade. If masters would always listen to the dictates of reason and humanity, they have frequently occasion rather to moderate, than to animate the application of many of their workmen. It will be found, I believe, in every sort of trade, that the man who works so moderately, as to be able to work constantly, not only preserves his health the longest, but, in the course of the year, executes the greatest quantity of work.

It's a lot on working parents and in a few days having 4 people using the bathroom regularly, the kitchen, etc that just means more cleaning. Toddlers typically don't clean up after themselves until they're old enough to be taught, so their rooms will get messy during independent play and toys will be everywhere within a day or two of not being kept up with. Every parent has had the experience of just finishing cleaning a room just to hear a toy box being dumped walking into another mess the kids created while they were busy. As for grocery shopping, most produce goes bad a few days after purchasing and a lot of people have do small shops multiple times a week, but I prefer getting the bulk of it done right before a weekend so it's one less thing to worry about.
