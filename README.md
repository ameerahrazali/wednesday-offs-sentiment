# Wednesdays Off ‚Äî The Unpopular Opinion That Wasn‚Äôt?

> A lighthearted NLP project exploring Reddit‚Äôs sentiment about taking Wednesdays off. Because who says weekends should only hug Fridays?

---

## Project Overview

Redditors love strong opinions, and one thread on [r/unpopularopinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion) sparked a curious debate:  
**Should we adopt a 4-day work week where Wednesday is the day off?**

Using over **1100 comments** scraped via Reddit‚Äôs API, this project:
- Cleans and tokenizes Reddit comment text
- Handles tricky language like **negation** (e.g., *"not bad"*)
- Applies **VADER** sentiment scoring
- Visualizes trends with **word clouds** and **score distributions**

The goal? To see how online voices *really* feel about a midweek pause and whether Wednesday deserves its moment.
